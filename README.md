Fork was created for a personal project. Only the fabric/common parts were needed for my project so I didnt bother resolving the forge issues. The gradle currently excludes forge but thats an easy fix. The MouseHandler Mixin has one todo. Hopefully this could be a good starting point to get you most of the way to a 1.20.4 port if you're considering doing that. Just review any changes (especially gradle ones cause im really bad with that) to make sure I didn't make any huge mistakes cause I have hardly ever worked with most of this stuff and this is the product of banging my head (and debug duck) against the wall for 2 hours.
